  ![Alt text](./images/scp.png)
- rsync - fast and efficient way to copy and synchronize data across directories, disks, and networks, and can be used for data backups
  - --dry-run: allows you to perform a trial run without making any changes to the system
  - -a: archive mode, which includes all the necessary options like copying files recursively, preserving almost everything (like symbolic links, file permissions, user & group ownership and timestamps).
  - -v: verbose mode, which provides more detailed output during the transfer process.  
  - -z: compresses the file data during the transfer.
  - -P: tells rsync to keep partially transferred files if the transfer is interrupted, so that it can resume the transfer from where it left off instead of starting over from the beginning and tells rsync to display a progress bar during the transfer, showing the percentage of the transfer completed and the estimated time remaining
