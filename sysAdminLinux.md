## ssh
    
### Basic SSH Usage

  * SSH logs are stored in `/var/log/auth.log`.
  * You can add your SSH server details to the `~/.ssh/config` file to improve the efficiency, security, and manageability of your SSH connections.
  * You should add your public key to the `.ssh/authorized_keys` directory on the server.
  * You can use the `-i` option to specify your public key file when connecting to a server.
  * You can use the `-p` option to specify the SSH port when connecting to a server.
  * The SSH configuration file on the server is stored in `/etc/ssh/sshd-config`.
  * You can use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate a new private/public key pair.
      * Use the `-C` option to add a comment to your public key.
      * Use the `-t` option to specify the type of key to generate. Common options include `rsa`, `dsa`, `ed25519` and `ecdsa`.

  ### SSH Port Forwarding

  * You can use SSH port forwarding to forward traffic from one port on your local machine to another port on a remote server.
  * To do this, you can use the `-L` or `-R` options when connecting to the server.
  * For example, to forward traffic from port 8080 on your local machine to port 80 on the remote server, you would use the following command:
  
        ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@remote_server

## Generate a Self-Signed Certificate Using OpenSSL
  
**1. Generate Key pair using OpenSSL** 

    openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048 

  This command will generate an `RSA` key pair with a length of `2048`.

**2. Extract the public key from the key pair**
 
    openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key
  extract the public key from the key pair generated in step 1.

**3. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** 
 
  The next step is to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). This will be used by the certificate authority (CA) to create the self-signed certificate. To generate the CSR, run this command in your terminal:

    openssl req -new -key private.key -out certificate.csr

  We suggest verifying the CSR generated before you submit it to the Certificate Authority. Run this command to verify the details of your CSR.

    openssl req -text -in certificate.csr -noout -verify
The `-noout` switch omits the output of the encoded version of the CSR. The `-verify` switch checks the signature of the file to make sure it hasn't been modified.

**4. Generate the self-signed certificate** 
  
  Finally, generate the self-signed certificate using the private key and CSR. Run this command to generate the self-signed certificate on the terminal:

    openssl x509 -in certificate.csr -out certificate.crt -req -signkey private.key -days 365
